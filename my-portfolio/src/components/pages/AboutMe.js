            I am a coding student, currently studying in a three month full-time full stack boot camp at the University of Toronto.

            I taught English as a Second Language in Japan for six years and then moved back to Canada and worked in the financial sector for seven years.

            When Iâ€™m not melting my brain with new coding concepts, I love playing board games or guitar and spending time with my dog, Pixel.
